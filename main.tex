\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a design science research approach to enhancing observability in microservices architectures through artificial intelligence. We propose and evaluate an AI-enhanced observability platform that addresses the challenges of comprehensive monitoring, anomaly detection, and performance prediction in complex, distributed microservices environments. Our research demonstrates how AI techniques such as Graph Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Natural Language Processing can be integrated to improve service dependency mapping, anomaly detection, and log analysis. Through experimental evaluation on a microservices-based e-commerce application, we show significant improvements in observability comprehensiveness, accuracy of root cause analysis, and mean time to resolve incidents compared to traditional observability tools.

\section{Introduction}
Microservices architectures have gained widespread adoption due to their flexibility, scalability, and ability to support rapid development cycles. However, these distributed systems pose significant challenges for observability, making it difficult to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize performance effectively \cite{ref1}.

This research addresses the following question: How can artificial intelligence enhance observability in microservices-based systems? We employ a design science research approach to develop and evaluate an AI-enhanced observability platform specifically tailored for microservices environments.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Traditional Observability in Microservices}
[Discuss current practices and their limitations]

\subsection{Machine Learning in Distributed Systems Monitoring}
[Review existing applications of ML in system monitoring]

Recent advancements in distributed systems monitoring have increasingly leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance system observability and automate the detection and diagnosis of performance issues. Traditional monitoring methods, which rely on predefined rules and manual analysis, struggle to keep up with the complexity and scale of modern distributed systems, especially microservices architectures [reference needed]. ML-based approaches, in contrast, offer scalable, data-driven solutions to these challenges, addressing anomaly detection, failure prediction, and root cause analysis (RCA) [reference needed].

Anomaly detection is a key application of ML in distributed systems. For instance, \cite{du2017deeplog} introduced DeepLog, an LSTM-based model that learns normal log patterns and detects deviations as anomalies. This approach improved accuracy over rule-based methods but was limited to logs, overlooking metrics and trace data, which are critical for a holistic view of system health.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Service Dependency Mapping using Graph Neural Networks
        \item Anomaly Detection and Performance Prediction using LSTM networks
        \item Log Analysis using Natural Language Processing
