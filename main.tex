\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a design science research approach to enhancing observability in microservices architectures through artificial intelligence. We propose and evaluate an AI-enhanced observability platform that addresses the challenges of comprehensive monitoring, anomaly detection, and performance prediction in complex, distributed microservices environments. Our research demonstrates how AI techniques such as Graph Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Natural Language Processing can be integrated to improve service dependency mapping, anomaly detection, and log analysis. Through experimental evaluation on a microservices-based e-commerce application, we show significant improvements in observability comprehensiveness, accuracy of root cause analysis, and mean time to resolve incidents compared to traditional observability tools.

\section{Introduction}
Microservices architectures have gained widespread adoption due to their flexibility, scalability, and ability to support rapid development cycles. However, these distributed systems pose significant challenges for observability, making it difficult to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize performance effectively \cite{ref1}.

This research addresses the following question: How can artificial intelligence enhance observability in microservices-based systems? We employ a design science research approach to develop and evaluate an AI-enhanced observability platform specifically tailored for microservices environments.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Traditional Observability in Microservices}
[Discuss current practices and their limitations]

\subsection{Machine Learning in Distributed Systems Monitoring}
[Review existing applications of ML in system monitoring]

Recent advancements in distributed systems monitoring have increasingly leveraged machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance system observability and automate the detection and diagnosis of performance issues. Traditional monitoring methods, which rely on predefined rules and manual analysis, struggle to keep up with the complexity and scale of modern distributed systems, especially microservices architectures [reference needed]. ML-based approaches, in contrast, offer scalable, data-driven solutions to these challenges, addressing anomaly detection, failure prediction, and root cause analysis (RCA) [reference needed].

Anomaly detection is a key application of ML in distributed systems. For instance, Du et al. (2017) \cite{du2017deeplog} introduced DeepLog, an LSTM-based model that learns normal log patterns and detects deviations as anomalies. This approach improved accuracy over rule-based methods but was limited to logs, overlooking metrics and trace data, which are critical for a holistic view of system health.

Kohyarnejadfard et al. (2022) proposed an innovative approach to anomaly detection in microservice environments by leveraging distributed tracing data and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Their work addresses the challenges posed by the complexity and short lifespan of microservices, particularly in detecting performance anomalies and release-over-release regressions. By using distributed tracing data, their method identifies sequences of events in spans without requiring prior system knowledge. Their experiments demonstrate high accuracy, achieving an F-score of 0.9759, and the system also aids root cause analysis through integrated visualization tools. Overall, their framework proves to be an effective tool for reducing troubleshooting time by guiding developers to the most relevant problem areas. They suggested future work to explore the impact of kernel tracing, other event arguments, and additional NLP techniques to enhance detection performance \cite{kohyarnejadfard2022anomaly}.

Nobre et al. (2023) conducted an investigation on the application of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), for anomaly detection in microservice-based systems. They created a microservices infrastructure and developed a fault injection module for simulating application and service-level anomalies, They also generated  a monitoring dataset for model validation. The results demonstrated that the MLP model effectively identified anomalies, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, particularly within the service-level anomaly dataset. The study emphasized the potential for enhancing the automation of distributed system monitoring and management by focusing on service-level metrics, such as response times. Future research directions included exploring the model's applicability in incremental learning scenarios, enabling continuous updates and adaptability to evolving performance data. Additionally, the authors suggested comparative analyses with other supervised techniques to identify the most effective methods for microservices anomaly detection. They also called for the development of reliable benchmarks to reflect real-world practices which would aid in advancing the field and enhancing model evaluation \cite{nobre2023anomaly}.

Zhang et al. (2023) conducted a study on automatic failure diagnosis in large microservice systems, emphasizing the significance of multimodal data by combining metrics, logs, and traces for accurate diagnosis. They proposed a method called DiagFusion that utilized embedding techniques and data augmentation to effectively represent multimodal data. DiagFusion constructed a dependency graph from deployment data and traces and employed a graph neural network (GNN) to identify the root cause of failures and determine failure types. Their evaluations demonstrated that DiagFusion significantly outperformed existing methods, improving root cause localization by 20.9\% to 368\% and failure type determination by 11.0\% to 169\% \cite{zhang2023robust}.

Zhao et al. (2023) explored proactive failure detection in microservice systems through their proposed method, AnoFusion. They highlighted the limitations of existing single-modal anomaly detection methods, which often overlooked the correlations within multimodal data, leading to missed failures and false alarms. AnoFusion employed a Graph Transformer Network (GTN) to capture the relationships among heterogeneous multimodal data and integrated a Graph Attention Network (GAT) with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to handle the dynamic nature of this data. Their evaluations on two datasets demonstrated that AnoFusion achieved F1 scores of 0.857 and 0.922, surpassing other recent proposed techniques. The authors concluded that their approach not only enhanced failure detection in microservice systems but also held potential for broader applications beyond this domain \cite{zhao2023robust}.
